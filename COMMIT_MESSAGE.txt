chore: bump version to 1.3.17 - fix critical flow generation issue

BREAKING FIX: ServiceNow Flow Designer Integration

This release fixes the critical "Flow sys_id not found" error that was preventing
generated flows from being recognized by ServiceNow Flow Designer.

Key fixes:
- Use sys_hub_action_instance_v2 instead of v1
- Encode action parameters as Base64+gzip arrays (not raw inputs)
- Add sys_hub_flow_logic_instance_v2 records to connect actions
- Include ui_id fields for visual designer rendering
- Use real ServiceNow action type sys_ids

Technical changes:
- Updated ImprovedFlowXMLGenerator with v2 encoding methods
- Added encodeActionParameters() for proper parameter array structure
- Implemented generateFlowLogicV2XML() for flow connections
- Updated action type mappings with real ServiceNow IDs

New analysis files:
- SERVICENOW_ACTION_ANALYSIS.md - Complete technical analysis
- action-v2-implementation.js - Reference implementation
- decode-action-values.js - Debugging utility

Impact: Flows generated with snow-flow will now properly import and execute
in ServiceNow Flow Designer without errors.
