  "objective": "create a multi agent implementation of claude-flow for a servicenow instance. As in the way that we do exactly the same as what claude-flow already does, multi agent orchestration of claude-code, but then for SerivceNow, for example I want that this cmd: [snow-flow swarm 'create a widget for X'] a multi agent orchestration spawns with multiple agents that would create a widget in servicenow, or anything ofcourse. We should look at claude-flows github and should duplicate as best as we could to get this product: https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow - this would be called snow-flow as a reference to servicenow that everyone calls snow wrongly and flow as in claude-flow. Just like claude-flow this snow-flow would live in the cli, orchestrating claude-code how to build, but then it would be always pointed towards servicenow. The user should give their OAuth or basic authentication and should be able to, kist like claude-flow, use their claude-code subscription to save on token costs. Claude-flow only orchestrates, claude-code creates so its important that we keep that aspect of the tool",
