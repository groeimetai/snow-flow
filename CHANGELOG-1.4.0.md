## üîÑ Migration Guide

### Before v1.4.0 (Broken)
```bash
# This no longer works
snow-flow swarm "create approval flow for equipment requests"
```

### After v1.4.0 (Working Alternative)
```bash
# Plan your flow requirements
snow-flow memory store flow_requirements "Need approval workflow with SLA tracking"

# Create flows in ServiceNow Flow Designer directly
# Use snow-flow for supporting components
snow-flow swarm "create approval dashboard widget"
```

## üìñ Alternative Approach

1. **Use snow-flow for planning and discovery:**
   - Store requirements in memory
   - Analyze related tables and fields
   - Create supporting widgets and business rules

2. **Create flows in ServiceNow Flow Designer:**
   - Log into your ServiceNow instance
   - Navigate to: Flow Designer > Designer
   - Use the visual interface for flow creation

3. **Use snow-flow for deployment management:**
   - Manage update sets
   - Deploy supporting components

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes

- Cleaned up MCP tool registry
- Updated CLI with deprecation error handlers
