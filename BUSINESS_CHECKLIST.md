# Snow-Flow Business Checklist

**Your Action Items for Business Setup & Capgemini Partnership**

This document outlines all business, legal, and strategic steps YOU need to complete to protect Snow-Flow IP, formalize the business, and prepare for Capgemini partnership.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Capgemini Employment vs Partnership Decision

**BEFORE accepting any Capgemini employment offer, you MUST resolve IP ownership!**

### ⚠️ The Problem with Employment

Most employment contracts contain clauses like:

```
"All intellectual property developed during employment,
including side projects related to company business,
becomes property of the employer."
```

**If you become Capgemini employee WITHOUT exception:**
- ❌ Snow-Flow enterprise features → Capgemini owns them
- ❌ Any code you write "on company time" → Capgemini IP
- ❌ Even personal time coding may be claimed if "related to ServiceNow work"
- ❌ You lose negotiating power (employee vs partner)

### ✅ Solutions (Pick ONE)

**Option A: Consultant/Contractor (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Structure: You remain independent (BV)
Contract: Professional services agreement (NOT employment)
Terms:
├── Fixed rate (€100-150/hour) or monthly retainer
├── Specific deliverables (enterprise features development)
├── IP ownership: Snow-Flow remains yours
├── Capgemini gets: License to use, implementation support
└── Exit clause: Either party can terminate with 30-60 days notice

Benefits:
✅ You keep 100% IP ownership
✅ Negotiate better rates (consultants charge more)
✅ Tax benefits (BV structure)
✅ Can work with other clients simultaneously
✅ Partnership leverage (not just employee)

Action Required:
[ ] Opricht BV (see checklist below)
[ ] Hire advocaat to draft consultant agreement
[ ] Negotiate IP exception clause explicitly
[ ] Define scope of work (enterprise features only)
```

**Option B: Employee with IP Assignment Exception (RISKY)**
```
Structure: Formal employment with Capgemini
Contract: Employment contract + IP addendum
Terms:
├── Salary: €XX,XXX per year
├── IP Addendum: "Snow-Flow and all related IP excluded from employer IP assignment"
├── Conflict waiver: "Snow-Flow development approved as side project"
└── Non-compete: Limited to direct ServiceNow competitors only

Benefits:
✅ Stable income (salary vs project-based)
✅ Benefits (health insurance, pension, vacation)
✅ Capgemini resources (infrastructure, testing environments)
✅ Career growth within Capgemini

Risks:
❌ IP exception may be rejected by Capgemini legal
❌ Gray area: What counts as "company time" vs "personal time"?
❌ Future disputes if Snow-Flow becomes valuable
❌ Non-compete may limit other partnerships

Action Required:
[ ] Hire employment lawyer (€1500-3000)
[ ] Draft IP assignment exception addendum
[ ] Get Capgemini HR + Legal to approve BEFORE signing
[ ] Document pre-existing IP (Snow-Flow v7.4.x as baseline)
[ ] Get written confirmation of side project approval
```

**Option C: Strategic Partnership (NO Employment) (BEST)**
```
Structure: Formal partnership between Snow-Flow BV and Capgemini
Contract: Strategic partnership agreement
Terms:
├── Capgemini investment: €500K-2M (10-20% equity)
├── Revenue commitment: €1M over 24 months
├── Co-development: Capgemini provides requirements, you develop
├── Distribution: Capgemini reseller with 30% margin
└── Board seat: Capgemini gets observer/board seat

Benefits:
✅ Capital to hire team (€500K+ runway)
✅ No employment restrictions
✅ You remain CEO/founder
✅ Capgemini committed (skin in the game)
✅ Clear exit path (acquisition option)

Risks:
❌ Equity dilution (you own 80-90% instead of 100%)
❌ Board oversight (quarterly reviews, reporting)
❌ Complex legal structure (€10K-20K legal costs)
❌ Longer negotiation (3-6 months vs 1 month)

Action Required:
[ ] Hire M&A/startup advocaat (€5K-15K)
[ ] Get company valuation (€2K-5K)
[ ] Draft term sheet for partnership
[ ] Due diligence preparation (financials, IP audit)
[ ] Negotiate investment terms
```

### 🎯 My Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Now - Month 3): Consultant Agreement**
- Start as consultant/contractor with fixed rate
- Deliver pilot enterprise features (Jira sync POC)
- Prove value without employment commitment
- Maintain 100% IP ownership

**Phase 2 (Month 4-6): Evaluate Partnership**
- If pilot succeeds → negotiate strategic partnership
- If Capgemini wants exclusivity → equity investment required
- If you want stable income → employee with IP exception

**Phase 3 (Month 6+): Formalize**
- Either full partnership agreement OR
- Employment with ironclad IP exception OR
- Continue as consultant long-term

**Why this works:**
- Low commitment initially (test the waters)
- Prove value before big decisions
- Keep options open (employment, partnership, or other clients)
- Build leverage (successful pilot = better negotiation position)

## 📋 Legal & Business Setup Checklist

### Priority 1: IP Protection (URGENT - Before Capgemini Talks)

#### [ ] Register "Snow-Flow" Trademark
**Why:** Protects brand, prevents Capgemini from using name without permission
**Cost:** €1,000 (Benelux) + €1,000 (EU-wide)
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks filing, 4-6 months approval
**How:**
1. Visit: https://boip.int (Benelux Office for Intellectual Property)
2. Register "Snow-Flow" for:
   - Class 9: Computer software
   - Class 42: Software as a Service (SaaS)
3. Upload logo (if you have one)
4. Pay fee: €239 (Benelux) or €1,000 (EU)
5. Monitor application status

**Files to prepare:**
- [ ] Logo design (if not yet created)
- [ ] Company details (if BV exists) or personal details
- [ ] Description of goods/services
- [ ] Evidence of prior use (GitHub commits, npm package)

**Contact:**
BOIP: +31 70 349 1111 | info@boip.int

---

#### [ ] Document Pre-Existing IP
**Why:** Proves Snow-Flow existed BEFORE Capgemini involvement
**Cost:** Free
**Timeline:** 1 day
**How:**
1. Download entire GitHub repository history (git archive)
2. Get npm download stats (https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=snow-flow)
3. Screenshot GitHub stars, forks, contributors
4. Export LICENSE file + commit history showing MIT since inception
5. Notarize or timestamp via blockchain (optional: €50)

**Files to create:**
- [ ] IP_BASELINE.md - Document all existing features as of today
- [ ] Git archive: `git archive --format=zip HEAD > snow-flow-v7.4.x-baseline.zip`
- [ ] Timestamp archive on blockchain (https://opentimestamps.org - free)

**Why this matters:**
If Capgemini later claims they contributed to core features, you have proof it existed before partnership.

---

#### [ ] File Provisional Patent (OPTIONAL - €3,000-5,000)
**Why:** Protects AI-assisted ServiceNow development method
**Cost:** €3,000-5,000 (provisional), €10,000-20,000 (full patent)
**Timeline:** 1-2 months filing, 18-36 months approval
**How:**
1. Hire patent attorney specialized in software/AI
2. File provisional patent: "Method for AI-Assisted ServiceNow Development"
3. Claims:
   - Multi-agent orchestration for ITSM platforms
   - Conversational development via MCP protocol
   - Local ML training on cloud platform data
   - Artifact synchronization for local development

**Is this worth it?**
- ✅ IF planning to license tech to multiple partners (Accenture, Deloitte, etc.)
- ✅ IF planning exit via acquisition (increases valuation)
- ❌ If only working with Capgemini (trademark + trade secrets sufficient)
- ❌ If budget is tight (spend on development instead)

**Recommended:** Skip for now, revisit if revenue > €500K/year

```
Scenario 1: Pilot Success → 10 Projects
10 projects x €700/project (70% of €1000) = €7,000/month

Scenario 2: Formal Partnership → 50 Projects
50 projects x €700/project = €35,000/month

Scenario 3: Full Scale → 150 Projects
150 projects x €700/project = €105,000/month
```

**4. Break-Even Analysis**
```
Monthly costs: €370
Break-even: 1 project (€700/month)
```

**5. Runway Calculation**
```
IF you invest €7,300 initially:
└── Runway: 19 months (€7,300 / €370)

IF you get first Capgemini payment (€7,000/month):

## 🚨 Critical Decisions You Must Make

### Decision 1: Employment vs Partnership with Capgemini

**[ ] Decide by:** End of Week 1

**Options:**
- **A: Consultant/Contractor** (recommended) - Keep IP, negotiate rates
- **B: Employee with IP Exception** (risky) - Stable income, but IP complexities
- **C: Strategic Partnership** (best long-term) - Equity investment, formal partnership

**My recommendation:** Start with (A) consultant, evaluate (C) after pilot success.

### Decision 2: Bootstrap vs Raise Capital

**[ ] Decide by:** Month 2

**Bootstrap (Recommended for now):**
- Self-fund €6K-10K initial costs
- Use Capgemini revenue to grow
- Maintain 100% ownership
- Slower growth but no dilution

**Raise Capital (Consider if fast scale needed):**
- Friends & Family: €20K-50K for 5-10% equity
- Angel Investors: €100K-250K for 10-20% equity
- Venture Capital: €500K-2M for 20-30% equity (too early)

**When to raise:**
- IF Capgemini partnership confirmed (proof of market)
- IF want to hire team quickly (developers, sales)
- IF multiple partnerships brewing (Accenture, Deloitte)

---

### Decision 3: Solo vs Build Team

**[ ] Decide by:** Month 6 (when revenue > €20K/month)

**Stay Solo (Years 1-2):**
- You do all development
- Outsource: accounting, legal, marketing
- Use Capgemini for testing/feedback
- Profit margin: 80-90%

**Build Team (Year 2+):**
- Hire: 1 developer (€4K-6K/month)
- Hire: 1 part-time sales/partnerships (€2K-3K/month)
- Hire: 1 support engineer (€3K-4K/month)
- Profit margin: 40-50% (lower, but scale faster)

**When to hire:**
- Development: When you can't keep up with features (backlog > 3 months)
- Sales: When you have 3+ partnership opportunities beyond Capgemini
- Support: When you have 50+ active projects (support load too high)
