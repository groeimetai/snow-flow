### Simple Wholesale + Retail Model

**You buy from us (Wholesale)**

# SLIDE 11: ROI FOR SERVICE INTEGRATORS

## 40-50% Faster ServiceNow Delivery

### The Time Savings

**Without Snow-Flow** (typical ServiceNow development):
- Manual Update Set tracking: **15-30 min/day**
- ES5 debugging in production: **2-4 hours/incident**
- Jira/ServiceNow context switching: **2-3 hours/day**
- Forgotten best practices: **4-6 hours/week fixing issues**

**Total wasted time**: ~**8-10 hours/week per consultant**

---

**With Snow-Flow Enterprise**:
- Automatic Update Set management: **0 minutes**
- ES5 validation during development: **0 production incidents**
- Unified backlog (Jira → ServiceNow): **0 context switching**
- Built-in best practices: **0 hours fixing preventable issues**

**Time saved**: ~**8-10 hours/week per consultant**

---

### Real Project Impact

**Feature Development Example**:

| Task | Without Snow-Flow | With Snow-Flow | Savings |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Widget creation | 4 hours | 2 hours | **50%** |
| Update Set management | 1 hour | 10 minutes | **83%** |
| Testing & debugging | 2 hours | 30 minutes | **75%** |
| Documentation | 1 hour | 20 minutes | **67%** |
| **Total** | **8 hours** | **4 hours** | **50%** |

**Result**: Complete one feature in **4 hours** instead of **8 hours**.

---

### Business Impact

**For a team of 100 consultants:**
- Time saved: 10 hours/week × 100 = **1,000 hours/week**
- At €80/hour billable rate: **€80,000/week** more capacity
- Annual value: **€4,160,000** more billable work

**Your Snow-Flow investment**: €54,000/year (100 seats × €45 × 12)
**ROI**: **7,600%** return on investment

# PRESENTATION TIPS

## Delivery Guidelines

**Timing**:

- Q&A: 15 minutes
- **Total**: 60 minutes

**Audience Engagement**:
- Ask about their ServiceNow practice size (Slide 3)
- Pause for questions after ROI slide (Slide 11)
- Interactive demo after Slide 12 (if possible)

**Key Messages to Emphasize**:
1. **40-50% faster delivery** (repeat 3-4 times)
2. **€14,400-360,000/year profit potential** (depending on partner size)
3. **30-day onboarding** (quick time-to-value)
4. **99.9% SLA** (enterprise reliability)
5. **Zero upfront investment** (risk-free)

**Objection Handling**:

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Our consultants already use [generic AI tool]" | "Generic tools aren't optimized for ServiceNow. We have 350+ ServiceNow-specific tools + Update Set automation." |
| "We can build this in-house" | "Building in-house costs €500,000+ in first year. With us, €0 upfront + €54,000/year for 100 seats. Plus, you can resell for €40,000+ annual profit." |
| "How do we know consultants will adopt it?" | "30-day pilot with 10 consultants. Measure time savings. If not 40-50% faster, walk away." |
| "What if our consultants leave?" | "You control the licenses. Ex-consultants lose access. Plus, Snow-Flow makes your consultants MORE productive = higher retention." |
