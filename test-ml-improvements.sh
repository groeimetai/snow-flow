echo "1. ✅ Smart ML Data Fetching:"
echo "   - First counts total records"
echo "   - Discovers fields from small sample (3 records)"
echo "   - Fetches in optimal batches (50 records) to avoid token limits"

echo "2. ✅ Token Limit Prevention:"
echo "   - Automatically reduces batch size if token limit approached"
echo "   - Calculates optimal batch size based on field count"
echo "   - Fallback to smaller batches on error"
echo ""
echo "3. ✅ Graceful Shutdown:"
echo "   - Reduced timeout from 5s to 2s"
echo "   - Non-blocking cleanup handlers"
echo "   - Async lock release to prevent hanging"

echo "4. ✅ ML Training Improvements:"
echo "   - Handles 500+ incidents without token errors"
echo "   - Intelligent field selection for ML"
echo "   - Progress tracking across batches"
