# Snow-Flow v8.4.3 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2025-10-23
**Type**: Feature Enhancement
**Breaking Changes**: No

---

## 🚀 New Features

### MCP Server Verification During Init

**Problem**: `snow-flow init` completed instantly without actually verifying that MCP servers can start, leaving users uncertain if their setup works.

**Solution**: Added real MCP server verification that actually spawns and tests each server.

**New Behavior**:

```bash
$ snow-flow init

🔧 Setting up MCP servers for OpenCode...
✓ Created .opencode/opencode.json with absolute paths

🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✓
   Testing snow-flow... ✓

   ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully
```

**Features**:

1. **Actual Server Startup Test**
   - Spawns each MCP server process
   - Waits for server response (5s timeout)
   - Verifies server can actually run

2. **Detailed Error Reporting**
   - Shows which server failed
   - Reports specific error (file not found, module missing, etc.)
   - Suggests fixes for common issues

3. **Smart Detection**
   - Detects missing server files
   - Identifies authentication requirements
   - Distinguishes between fatal and non-fatal issues

**Example Output**:

```bash
# Success (all servers work):
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✓
   Testing snow-flow... ✓

   ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully

# Partial failure (one server broken):
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✗ (server file not found)
      Check: /path/to/dist/mcp/servicenow-mcp-unified/index.js
   Testing snow-flow... ✓

   ⚠️  1 verified, 1 failed
   Run with credentials configured to fully test servers

# Warning (server needs auth):
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ⚠ (no response, may need credentials)
   Testing snow-flow... ⚠ (no response, may need credentials)

   ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Verification Process

```typescript
async function verifyMCPServers(targetDir: string): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Read .opencode/opencode.json
  const config = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(configPath));

  // 2. For each enabled MCP server:
  for (const server of config.mcp) {
    // 3. Spawn server process
    const serverProcess = spawn(server.command, server.args, {
      env: server.env,
      stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']
    });

    // 4. Wait for response (5s timeout)
    // 5. Check stdout/stderr for output
    // 6. Report success/failure
    // 7. Kill test process
  }
}
```

**Timeout Strategy**:
- **5 seconds** per server (reasonable for Node.js startup)
- Kills process after timeout
- Considers "no response with no errors" as success (server may need auth)

**Error Detection**:
- `Cannot find module` → Server file missing
- `ENOENT` → Command not found
- Stderr output → Server error
- No output + timeout → May need credentials (treated as success)

## 📊 What's Verified

| Check | Description | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **File Exists** | Server file at configured path exists | ✓/✗ |
| **Node.js Can Load** | No syntax errors, dependencies found | ✓/✗ |
| **Server Starts** | Process spawns without crashing | ✓/✗ |
| **Server Responds** | Outputs to stdout/stderr | ✓/⚠ |

**Note**: Full tool availability requires credentials configured in `.env`

## 🎯 Benefits

**Before v8.4.3**:
```bash
$ snow-flow init
✅ Snow-Flow project initialized successfully!
# User: "Did it actually work? No idea..."
```

**After v8.4.3**:
```bash
$ snow-flow init
✅ Snow-Flow project initialized successfully!

🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✓
   Testing snow-flow... ✓

   ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully

# User: "Great! I know the servers work!"
```

---

## 🚧 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Everything Works
```bash
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✓
   Testing snow-flow... ✓

   ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully
```
**Action**: None needed! Proceed to configure credentials.

### Scenario 2: Server File Not Found
```bash
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✗ (server file not found)
      Check: /wrong/path/to/index.js

   ⚠️  0 verified, 1 failed
```
**Action**: Run `snow-flow init --force` to regenerate config with correct paths.

### Scenario 3: Missing Dependencies
```bash
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ✗
      Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'

   ⚠️  0 verified, 1 failed
```
**Action**: Reinstall snow-flow: `npm install -g snow-flow@latest`

### Scenario 4: Needs Credentials (OK)
```bash
🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
   Testing servicenow-unified... ⚠ (no response, may need credentials)

   ✅ All 1 MCP server(s) verified successfully
```
**Action**: Normal! Configure `.env` with ServiceNow credentials.

## 📦 Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `src/cli.ts` - Added `verifyMCPServers()` function (107 lines)
- `src/cli.ts` - Integrated verification into `init` command

---

## 🔍 Verification

Test the new feature:

```bash
# Install v8.4.3
npm install -g snow-flow@8.4.3

# Run init (now includes verification)
cd your-project
snow-flow init

# Watch for verification step:
# 🔍 Verifying MCP server configuration...
#    Testing servicenow-unified... ✓
#    Testing snow-flow... ✓
#
#    ✅ All 2 MCP server(s) verified successfully
```

**Expected behavior**:
- Init takes ~10 seconds instead of instant (2 servers × 5s max each)
- Shows real-time verification status
- Reports any issues with specific servers
- Provides actionable error messages

---

## 🎓 What This Means for Users

**Before**: "I ran init, but do the MCP servers work? Who knows..."

**After**: "I ran init, it verified both servers started successfully. I'm confident my setup works!"

**Key Improvement**: Users now have **immediate feedback** about MCP server health, not just configuration file creation.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the community for reporting that init completed too quickly without verification!
