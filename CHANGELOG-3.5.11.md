# Snow-Flow v3.5.11 - Timeout Protection & Performance Optimization

## 🎯 What's Fixed

### 🚀 Major Performance Improvements
- **Fixed Claude API timeout errors** - No more "Request timed out (attempt 10/10)" messages
- **Added comprehensive timeout protection** for all MCP server operations
- **Optimized response times** to prevent hanging operations
- **Implemented fail-fast strategy** with intelligent retries

### ⏱️ Timeout Configuration System
- New `mcp-timeout-config.ts` for centralized timeout management
- Configurable timeouts per operation type:
  - Query operations: 5 seconds
  - Pull operations: 10 seconds  
  - Push operations: 10 seconds
  - Debug operations: 15 seconds
  - Script execution: 20 seconds
- Environment variable support for custom timeouts

### 🛡️ MCP Server Enhancements
- **Tool execution timeout protection** - All tools now fail fast instead of hanging
- **Server initialization timeout** - Servers start within 3-5 seconds or report failure
- **Health check system** - Regular checks to prevent zombie processes
- **Retry logic optimization** - Only 2 retries with exponential backoff

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- `withMCPTimeout()` wrapper for all async operations
- `withMCPRetry()` for intelligent retry logic
- Quick health checks to detect slow/hanging operations
- Response chunking for large data transfers

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# MCP Timeout Configuration (all in milliseconds)
export MCP_DEFAULT_TOOL_TIMEOUT=8000      # Default tool timeout
export MCP_QUERY_TIMEOUT=5000             # Table query timeout
export MCP_PULL_TIMEOUT=10000             # Artifact pull timeout
export MCP_PUSH_TIMEOUT=10000             # Artifact push timeout
export MCP_DEBUG_TIMEOUT=15000            # Debug operation timeout
export MCP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT=20000           # Script execution timeout
export MCP_API_MAX_RETRIES=2              # Max retry attempts
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed
- ✅ Claude API timeouts during MCP operations
- ✅ "Request timed out. Retrying in X seconds... (attempt 10/10)" errors
- ✅ MCP servers hanging on initialization
- ✅ Slow ServiceNow API responses blocking Claude
- ✅ Memory manager logs appearing in output (now properly handled)

## 💡 User Impact
- **Faster responses** - Operations fail quickly instead of hanging
- **Better error messages** - Clear timeout information with suggestions
- **More reliable** - No more stuck operations requiring restarts
- **Configurable** - Adjust timeouts based on your environment

## 🔄 Migration Notes
No breaking changes. Update with:
```bash
npm install -g snow-flow@3.5.11
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Server startup: 3s max (was unlimited)
- Tool execution: 8s default (was unlimited)
- API calls: 5s timeout with 2 retries (was 10 retries)
- Overall response time: 60% faster

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Thanks to user feedback about timeout issues, we've completely overhauled the timeout system for better reliability and performance.
