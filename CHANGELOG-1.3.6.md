# Snow-Flow v1.3.6 - Nested Object Defaults Fix

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Zod Schema Validation Error

Fixed a critical Zod validation error that prevented the package from starting up. The error occurred because nested objects within the configuration schema were missing default values.

## 🔧 Issue Details

When running `snow-flow --version`, users encountered the following error:
```
ZodError: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "object",
    "received": "undefined",
    "path": ["agents", "queen"],
    "message": "Required"
  },
  // ... similar errors for all nested objects
]
```

## ✅ Solution

Added `.default({})` to all nested object schemas in the configuration:
- `agents.queen`, `agents.worker`, `agents.specializations` (and all sub-objects)
- `memory.schema`, `memory.cache`, `memory.ttl`, `memory.cleanup`
- `mcp.servers` (and all server sub-objects), `mcp.transport`, `mcp.authentication`
- `servicenow.retryConfig`, `servicenow.cache`, `servicenow.oauth`
- `monitoring.performance`, `monitoring.health`, `monitoring.alerts`
- `health.checks`, `health.thresholds`

## 📋 Technical Details

The issue was that while top-level objects had `.default({})` added in v1.3.4, the nested objects within them were still required by Zod but had no default values. When `ConfigSchema.parse({})` was called with an empty object, Zod expected all nested objects to exist.

## 🚀 Result

- Package now starts correctly without Zod validation errors
- All configuration objects have proper default values at all nesting levels
- Backwards compatibility maintained

## 📦 Version Status
