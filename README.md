## üîß Advanced Features

### üåä Flow Composer MCP - Natural Language Flow Creation

Snow-Flow's Flow Composer MCP is a powerful tool that creates complete ServiceNow flows from natural language:

```javascript
// Create complex flows with multi-artifact orchestration
await snow_create_complex_flow({
  instruction: "Create a flow that translates incident descriptions to English using LLM when priority is high"
});

// Analyze flow requirements
await snow_analyze_flow_instruction({
  instruction: "approval flow with manager and director approval for purchases over ‚Ç¨5000"
});

// Discover and orchestrate artifacts
await snow_discover_flow_artifacts({
  instruction: "use the translation script include to process support messages",
  artifact_types: ['script_include', 'business_rule', 'table']
});

// Preview flow structure before deployment
await snow_preview_flow_structure({
  instruction: "incident escalation flow with automatic assignment based on category"
});
```

**Flow Composer Features:**
- üß† **Natural Language Understanding**: Parses complex instructions in any language
- üîç **Intelligent Artifact Discovery**: Finds and links existing ServiceNow components
- üîó **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: Maps data flow between artifacts
- üéØ **Smart Fallback Creation**: Creates missing artifacts when needed
- ‚ö° **Direct Deployment**: Deploys complete flows to Flow Designer
- üìä **Error Handling**: Automatic retry and validation logic

### ‚ö° Update Set Management

All deployments are automatically tracked in Update Sets for safe production deployment:

```javascript
// Create Update Set for a user story
await snow_update_set_create({
  name: "STORY-123: Add incident translation flow",
  description: "Implements automatic translation for support messages",
  user_story: "STORY-123"
});

// Track artifacts in current Update Set
await snow_update_set_add_artifact({
  type: "flow",
  sys_id: "flow_sys_id_here",
  name: "incident_translation_flow"
});

// Preview all changes
await snow_update_set_preview();

// Export for production deployment
await snow_update_set_export({
  output_path: "./exports/STORY-123.xml"
});
```

### üß† Intelligent Natural Language Processing
Snow-Flow features advanced AI-powered natural language processing for ServiceNow artifacts:

```bash
# Find artifacts using natural language
snow-flow find "the widget that shows incidents on the homepage"
snow-flow find "approval flow for hardware requests over ‚Ç¨1000"

# Edit using natural language instructions
snow-flow edit "pas de flow aan met de naam 'approval request flow' en zorg dat er na de approval stap een mailtje naar test@admin.nl wordt gestuurd"

# Analyze and understand complex ServiceNow artifacts
snow-flow analyze "incident management widget" --deep-index
```

### üîç Intelligent Artifact Discovery
Snow-Flow automatically discovers and indexes ServiceNow artifacts with intelligent memory:

- **Smart Search**: Find artifacts using natural language descriptions
- **Contextual Understanding**: AI understands artifact purpose and relationships
- **Memory Indexing**: Large scripts and flows are intelligently indexed for optimal Claude interaction
- **Modification Points**: Automatically identifies where and how artifacts can be modified

### Direct ServiceNow Deployment
Snow-Flow includes specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for direct ServiceNow deployment:

```javascript
// Deploy widgets directly to ServiceNow
await snow_deploy_widget({
  name: 'incident_dashboard',
  title: 'Incident Management Dashboard',
  template: widgetHTML,
  css: widgetCSS,
  client_script: clientScript,
  server_script: serverScript,
  category: 'incident'
});

// Deploy Flow Designer flows with approval logic
await snow_deploy_flow({
  name: 'purchase_approval',
  description: 'Purchase approval with task creation',
  table: 'sc_request',
  trigger_type: 'record_created',
  condition: 'category=hardware',
  flow_definition: flowJSON,
  category: 'approval'
});

// Deploy composed flows with linked artifacts
await snow_deploy_flow({
  name: 'translation_flow',
  description: 'Translate and store support messages',
  composed_flow: true,
  linked_artifacts: [
    { type: 'script_include', name: 'LLMTranslationUtil' },
    { type: 'business_rule', name: 'StoreTranslatedMessage' },
    { type: 'table', name: 'u_translations' }
  ],
  flow_definition: composedFlowJSON
});
```

### ü§ñ Intelligent Multi-Agent Coordination
Snow-Flow uses advanced batch processing with intelligent artifact understanding:

```javascript
// Intelligent artifact processing with memory indexing
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "discover_artifacts",
    content: "Discover and index existing ServiceNow artifacts",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    id: "analyze_requirements", 
    content: "Analyze modification requirements using natural language",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high"
  }
]);

// Agents work with intelligent memory
Task("ServiceNow Discovery Agent", "Find and index 'approval request flow' using natural language processing");
Task("Contextual Editor Agent", "Apply modifications based on memory-indexed artifact structure");
Task("Deployment Agent", "Deploy modified artifacts back to ServiceNow");
Task("Memory Manager", "Update intelligent index with modification history");

// Intelligent memory storage for ServiceNow artifacts
Memory.store("servicenow_artifacts", {
  indexed_flows: [...],
  modification_history: [...],
  common_patterns: [...]
});
```

### Deployment Management
- **Validation**: Test before deployment
- **Rollback**: Safe deployment with rollback capability
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor deployment history
- **Update Sets**: Production-ready deployments

## üîê Security & Authentication

### OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
Snow-Flow uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for secure authentication:

- **Secure Token Storage**: Tokens encrypted and stored locally
- **Automatic Refresh**: Token refresh handled automatically
- **Instance Isolation**: Each ServiceNow instance has separate credentials
- **Secure Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS with proper authentication

### Environment Security
```bash
# Secure environment variables
chmod 600 .env            # Restrict access to .env file
git update-index --assume-unchanged .env  # Prevent accidental commits
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Authentication Failures**
```bash
# Clear cached credentials
snow-flow auth logout
snow-flow auth login

# Check ServiceNow OAuth configuration
# Ensure redirect URL is: http://localhost:3005/callback
```

**2. Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Snow-Flow uses port 3005 by default
# If port is busy, close other applications or change port in OAuth settings
```

**3. Timeout Issues**
```bash
# Increase timeout for complex tasks
export SNOW_FLOW_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=120

# Or disable timeout completely
export SNOW_FLOW_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=0
```

**4. Widget Deployment Failures**
```bash
# Check ServiceNow permissions
# Ensure user has sp_admin role for widget deployment
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Test ServiceNow connection
snow-flow auth status
```

## üìä Performance & Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor swarm execution
snow-flow swarm "objective" --monitor

# Check system performance
snow-flow status --detailed

# View deployment history
snow-flow deploy status
```

### Batch Operations
Snow-Flow maximizes efficiency through:
- **Parallel Agent Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Batch API Calls**: Minimize ServiceNow API calls
- **Memory Coordination**: Efficient data sharing between agents
- **Optimized Deployment**: Direct deployment without intermediate files
