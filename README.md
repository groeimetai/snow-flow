#### 🎯 **Universal Query Tool** - One Tool for ALL Tables
The revolutionary `snow_query_table` replaces all table-specific query tools with intelligent performance optimization:

```javascript
// Smart Performance Modes - System auto-detects the best approach:

// 1. Analytics mode - OMIT limit for ALL records with minimal fields
snow_query_table({ 
  table: "incident", 
  query: "state!=7",
  fields: ["sys_created_on", "priority"]  // Get ALL records, minimal data
})
// Auto-detects analytics context and returns ALL records!

// 2. Count-only mode - Ultra efficient for large datasets
snow_query_table({ 
  table: "sc_request",
  include_content: false  // Just counts, no data
})
// Returns: {total_results: 15234} - Maximum efficiency!

// 3. Display mode - Limited records with full details
snow_query_table({ 
  table: "problem",
  limit: 50,  // Explicitly limit for display
  include_display_values: true
})

// 4. Group by aggregation - Server-side analytics
snow_query_table({ 
  table: "change_request",
  group_by: "risk",
  order_by: "-count"  // Sorted by frequency
})
```

Works with ANY table: `incident`, `sc_request`, `problem`, `cmdb_ci`, even `u_custom_table`!

```bash
# Find similar incidents using ServiceNow's clustering
snow-flow ml predictive-intelligence --operation similar_incidents --incident INC0123456
# Output: Top 10 similar incidents with resolution patterns

# Get solution recommendations
snow-flow ml predictive-intelligence --operation solution_recommendation --incident INC0123456
# Output: KB articles, past resolutions, confidence scores
```

**Agent Intelligence Work Assignment**
```bash
# Get AI-powered assignment recommendations
snow-flow ml agent-intelligence --task incident --id INC0123456 --auto-assign
# Output: Best agent match based on skills, workload, and success rate
```
