⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Snow-Flow automatically manages Update Sets for you!**

- **🆕 Automatic Creation**: When you start a session, Snow-Flow automatically creates a new Update Set
- **📌 Session Persistence**: All changes during your session are tracked in this Update Set
- **🔄 Continuous Work**: Snow-Flow continues using the same Update Set until you explicitly switch
- **💾 Change Tracking**: Every ServiceNow modification is automatically captured for deployment

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Session 1: Snow-Flow creates "AUTO_2025-08-03_widget_development"
snow-flow swarm "Create incident dashboard widget"
# All changes go into this Update Set

# Same session: Want a new Update Set? Just ask!
# Simply tell Snow-Flow: "please create a new update set for the authentication feature"
# Snow-Flow will create a new Update Set and switch to it

# Session 2: Still using the last active Update Set
snow-flow swarm "Add authentication to the dashboard"
# Changes continue in the same Update Set from where you left off
```

**Key Points:**
- 🔄 **Same Session Flexibility**: Within the same conversation, just ask Snow-Flow to create a new Update Set
- 💬 **Natural Language**: Say "create a new update set for [feature]" at any point
- 📌 **Session Memory**: Snow-Flow remembers which Update Set is active across sessions
- 🎯 **No New Command Needed**: No need to start a new swarm command

**Best Practices:**
- Let Snow-Flow manage Update Sets automatically
- Ask for new Update Sets when switching to different features
- Review your current Update Set with `snow_update_set_current`
- Export Update Sets before major deployments
