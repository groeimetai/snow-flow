# Snow-Flow: ServiceNow Hive-Mind Intelligence 🧠

**Snow-Flow** revolutionizes ServiceNow development through **claude-flow inspired hive-mind architecture**. One elegant command spawns intelligent AI agents that collaborate to build, test, and deploy professional ServiceNow solutions automatically.

## 🧠 The Hive-Mind Revolution

**Inspired by claude-flow philosophy: "One Queen, many simple agents, simple memory, learn and adapt"**

- 👑 **Queen Agent**: Master coordinator that analyzes objectives and spawns specialist agents
- 🤖 **Worker Agents**: ServiceNow specialists (Widget Creator, Flow Builder, Script Writer, Security, Test)
- 💾 **Shared Memory**: SQLite-based persistent coordination system
- 🎯 **Claude Code Integration**: All coordination happens through Claude Code interface
- 🚀 **One Command**: `snow-flow swarm "objective"` - everything else is automatic

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES: v1.3.28 - All Beta Testing Issues RESOLVED! ✅

### 🎉 Complete Solution for ALL Three Critical Issues

**Issue #1: Flow Deployment Creates Empty Flows - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: Flows were deploying "successfully" but were completely empty or missing 90% of features
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete XML generation, wrong table versions (v1 instead of v2), missing encoding
- **Solution**: New `CompleteFlowXMLGenerator` with:
  - ✅ Correct v2 tables (sys_hub_action_instance_v2, sys_hub_trigger_instance_v2)
  - ✅ Proper Base64+gzip encoding for action values
  - ✅ Comprehensive label_cache structure
  - ✅ ALL flow components fully supported
- **Result**: Flows now deploy with 100% of requested features working!

**Issue #2: Tool Registry Mapping Failures - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: Tool names between MCP providers were inconsistent causing failures
- **Example**: `mcp__servicenow-operations__snow_table_schema_discovery` doesn't exist
- **Solution**: New `MCPToolRegistry` with:
  - ✅ Robust tool name resolution with aliases
  - ✅ Fuzzy matching for partial names
  - ✅ Provider-specific tool discovery
  - ✅ Automatic mapping between naming conventions
- **Result**: Tools always resolve correctly regardless of how they're referenced!

**Issue #3: Metadata Response Failures - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅**
- **Problem**: Deployment responses had sys_id always null, no API endpoints
- **Root Cause**: ServiceNow responses vary widely, metadata extraction was incomplete
- **Solution**: New `DeploymentMetadataHandler` with:
  - ✅ Multiple fallback methods to find sys_id
  - ✅ Searches by name, update set, and direct API
  - ✅ Always returns complete metadata
  - ✅ Comprehensive verification after deployment
- **Result**: All deployments return complete, verified metadata!

### 🚀 How It Works Now

```bash
# One command creates COMPLETE flows with ALL features
snow-flow swarm "create incident management flow with SLA tracking, automated assignment, knowledge base, and escalation"

# Result:
# ✅ Flow created with ALL 10+ requested features working
# ✅ Proper sys_id returned: abc123-def456-...
# ✅ API endpoint: https://instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/sys_hub_flow/abc123
# ✅ UI URL: https://instance.service-now.com/flow-designer/abc123
# ✅ Performance recommendations included
# ✅ Complete verification of deployment
```
