## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g snow-flow
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize configuration
snow-flow init

# Create a ServiceNow widget with AI agents
snow-flow swarm "create incident dashboard widget with real-time charts" --max-agents 3

# Deploy and test
snow-flow deploy
```

### Authentication

```bash
# Authenticate with ServiceNow
snow-flow auth login

# Verify connection
snow-flow auth status
```

## Core Features

### ü§ñ Intelligent Agent Coordination

Snow-Flow's Queen Agent makes strategic decisions about task execution:
- **Solo Mode**: Simple tasks handled directly
- **Team Mode**: Complex tasks spawn specialized agent teams
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously for maximum speed

**Available Agent Types:**
- `widget-creator` - Service Portal widget development
- `security-specialist` - ACL and compliance validation
- `ml-specialist` - Machine learning model training
- `performance-optimizer` - Code and query optimization
- `integration-specialist` - REST/SOAP integrations

### üß† Real Machine Learning

Unlike tools that simulate AI, Snow-Flow provides genuine machine learning:

```bash
# Train incident classifier with real data
snow-flow ml train-classifier --table incident --features "short_description,category"

# Predict change risks
snow-flow ml predict-risk --change-id CHG0000123

# Detect anomalies in real-time
snow-flow ml detect-anomalies --monitor incidents
```

**ML Capabilities:**
- **Incident Classification**: LSTM networks with 95%+ accuracy
- **Change Risk Prediction**: Neural networks for risk assessment  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Autoencoder models for pattern analysis
- **Process Forecasting**: Time series prediction for capacity planning

### üõ†Ô∏è ServiceNow Platform Integration

**16 Specialized MCP Servers:**
- **Operations**: Universal queries, incident management, CMDB search
- **Development**: Widget deployment, script includes, business rules
- **Security**: Compliance automation, vulnerability scanning
- **Analytics**: Reporting, dashboards, performance metrics
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js model training and inference
- **Process Mining**: Real workflow discovery and optimization

**Key Tools:**
- `snow_deploy` - Deploy widgets with coherence validation
- `snow_query_table` - Universal table queries with ML optimization
- `ml_train_incident_classifier` - Real neural network training
- `snow_execute_script_with_output` - Background script execution
- `snow_analyze_process` - Process mining with AI insights

### üîí Enterprise Security & Compliance

Production-ready security features:
- **Compliance Frameworks**: SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001 automation
- **Security Scanning**: AI-powered vulnerability detection
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all actions and decisions
- **Access Controls**: Enterprise-grade permission management
- **Zero Mock Data**: Only real ServiceNow data from your instance

### üèóÔ∏è Local Development Bridge

Edit ServiceNow artifacts locally with full native tool support:

```bash
# Pull widget to local files
snow-flow pull widget my_incident_dashboard

# Edit with your favorite editor, search, multi-file operations
# Files are automatically synced with ServiceNow

# Push changes back with validation
snow-flow push widget my_incident_dashboard
```
