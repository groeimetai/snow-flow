# Snow-Flow v1.3.8 - Claude Code Agent Orchestration Fix

## ðŸ¤– Critical Fix: Restored Claude Code Agent Spawning

Fixed the critical issue where Snow-flow was not properly orchestrating Claude Code agents for complex tasks.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Wrong

1. **Early Exit for Flows**: When detecting a Flow Designer task, the system generated an XML template and then immediately returned, skipping all agent orchestration
2. **Wrong Claude Code Execution**: The system tried to spawn Claude Code as a CLI tool (which doesn't exist)
3. **No Multi-Agent Coordination**: Because of the above, Claude Code agents were never used

## âœ… What's Fixed

1. **No More Early Exit**: Flow Designer tasks now continue to the full Queen Agent orchestration
2. **Proper Claude Code Instructions**: Clear instructions for users to paste prompts into Claude Code
3. **Clear Role Separation**:
   - Snow-flow = **Orchestrator** (coordinates the work)
   - Claude Code = **Workhorses** (implement the solution)

## ðŸš€ How It Works Now

```bash
# User runs:
snow-flow swarm "create approval flow for equipment requests"

# Snow-flow:
1. Generates basic XML template (for flows)
2. Creates comprehensive Queen Agent orchestration prompt
3. Shows clear instructions to paste prompt into Claude Code

# User pastes prompt into Claude Code

# Claude Code agents:
1. Analyze detailed requirements from the objective
2. Design complete flow logic with all activities
3. Add approval steps, notifications, conditions, etc.
4. Test the flow implementation
5. Deploy to ServiceNow
```

## ðŸ“‹ Key Changes

- Removed early return in Flow Designer detection (cli.ts line 263)
- Simplified executeClaudeCode function to always return false
- Updated user messaging to emphasize Snow-flow/Claude Code roles
- XML template is now clearly marked as "just a basic template"

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

The swarm command now properly orchestrates Claude Code agents to do the actual implementation work, while Snow-flow remains the coordinator. This restores the intended multi-agent architecture where:

- Snow-flow prepares the orchestration
- Claude Code agents do the heavy lifting
- Complex flows get properly implemented with all required logic

## ðŸ’¡ Remember

When you see the Queen Agent orchestration prompt:
1. Copy the ENTIRE prompt
2. Paste it into Claude Code
3. Let the agents work their magic!
