## Critical Path Analysis

### Must-Have Sequence (Cannot Parallelize)
```
1. Shared Infrastructure → 2. Core Server → 3. Update Set → 4. Intelligent → 5. Deployment
```

### Parallelizable Groups
```
Phase 3: All Domain Services can deploy simultaneously
Phase 5: Medium complexity services can deploy in parallel
```

### External Dependencies
- **Neo4j Database**: Required only for graph-memory service (optional)
- **ServiceNow Instance**: Required for all services (provided)
- **Redis/Cache**: Recommended for intelligent service (can be added)

## Resource Requirements

### Shared Infrastructure Cluster
```yaml
shared-auth-service:
  cpu: "500m"
  memory: "512Mi" 
  replicas: 3
  storage: "1Gi" # For session state

shared-config-service:
  cpu: "200m"
  memory: "256Mi"
  replicas: 2
  storage: "500Mi" # For config cache

shared-logging-service:
  cpu: "300m"
  memory: "1Gi"
  replicas: 2
  storage: "10Gi" # For log aggregation

shared-api-gateway:
  cpu: "1000m"
  memory: "1Gi"
  replicas: 3
  storage: "2Gi" # For rate limiting cache
```

### Service Resource Requirements
```yaml
# EASY Services (🟢)
easy-services:
  cpu: "200-500m"
  memory: "256-512Mi"
  replicas: 2
  storage: "100Mi"

# MEDIUM Services (🟡)  
medium-services:
  cpu: "500m-1000m"
  memory: "512Mi-1Gi"
  replicas: 2-3
  storage: "500Mi"

# HARD Services (🔴)
hard-services:
  cpu: "1000m-2000m"
  memory: "1-2Gi"
  replicas: 3-5
  storage: "1-5Gi"
```

## Success Validation Checklist

### Phase 1 - Infrastructure ✅

- [ ] Logging service aggregates logs from test applications
- [ ] API gateway proxies requests to ServiceNow successfully

### Phase 2 - Core API ✅  
- [ ] Core server responds to basic MCP protocol requests
- [ ] Widget creation through HTTP endpoints works
- [ ] ServiceNow API connectivity confirmed

### Phase 3 - Domain Services ✅
- [ ] Each domain service independently handles requests
- [ ] No cross-service dependencies during operation
- [ ] All services register with service discovery

### Phase 4 - Update Set Management ✅
- [ ] Update set creation/switching works across services
- [ ] Session state persists across service restarts
- [ ] Deployment tracking functions properly

### Phase 5 - Medium Complexity ✅
- [ ] Integration service handles external API calls
- [ ] Security service performs compliance scans
- [ ] Flow composer generates valid ServiceNow flows

### Phase 6 - Intelligence Layer ✅
- [ ] Artifact discovery works with distributed caching
- [ ] Search performance meets SLA requirements
- [ ] Memory systems handle concurrent access

### Phase 7 - Advanced Deployment ✅
- [ ] Complex deployment workflows coordinate across services
- [ ] Rollback functionality works with distributed state
- [ ] Integration with intelligence and update-set services confirmed

### Phase 8 - Graph Memory ✅
- [ ] Neo4j integration functions properly
- [ ] Fallback mode works when Neo4j unavailable
- [ ] Graph analytics provide meaningful insights

## Monitoring & Observability Strategy

### Health Check Endpoints
```bash
# Infrastructure Health
curl -f http://auth-service:8080/health
curl -f http://config-service:8081/health
curl -f http://logging-service:8082/health
curl -f http://api-gateway:8083/health

# Service Health (Example)
curl -f http://servicenow-operations:3001/health
curl -f http://servicenow-deployment:3010/health
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Authentication Service**: Token generation rate, failure rate
2. **API Gateway**: Request throughput, ServiceNow API rate limits
3. **Intelligence Service**: Cache hit ratio, search response time
4. **Deployment Service**: Success/failure rates, rollback frequency
5. **All Services**: Memory usage, CPU utilization, error rates
