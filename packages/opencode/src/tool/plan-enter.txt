Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task.
Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort.
This tool asks the user if they want to switch to plan mode.

## When to Use This Tool

**Prefer using plan mode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple.
Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:

1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality
2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways
3. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files
4. **Architectural Decisions**: Choosing between patterns or technologies
5. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope
6. **Significant Refactoring**: Restructuring existing code across multiple files

## When NOT to Use This Tool

- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- The user explicitly asks to skip planning
- Simple config changes

## Important

- This tool REQUIRES user approval — they must consent to entering plan mode
- If the user explicitly requests planning, ALWAYS call this tool first
- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning
