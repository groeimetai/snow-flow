title: Agent Client Protocol
description: Use OpenCode in any ACP-compatible editor.
---

OpenCode supports the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com), allowing you to use it directly in compatible editors and IDEs.

ACP is an open protocol that standardizes communication between code editors and AI coding agents. Similar to LSP for language servers, ACP allows agents like OpenCode to work seamlessly across different development environments.

:::tip
For a list of editors and tools that support ACP, see the [ACP progress report](https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#available-now).

## Configure

To use OpenCode via ACP, configure your editor to run the `opencode acp` command.

The command starts OpenCode as an ACP-compatible subprocess that communicates with your editor over JSON-RPC via stdio.

Below are examples for popular editors that support ACP.

---

### Zed

Add to your Zed configuration (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "OpenCode": {
      "command": "opencode",
      "args": ["acp"]
    }
  }
}
```

To open it, use the `agent: new thread` action in the Command Palette

You can also bind a keyboard shortcut by editing your `keymap.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "bindings": {
      "cmd-alt-o": ["agent::NewExternalAgentThread", { "agent": "OpenCode" }]
    }
  }
]
```

### Avante.nvim

Add to your Avante configuration:

```lua
{
  acp_providers = {
    ["opencode"] = {
      command = "opencode",
      args = { "acp" }
    }
  }
}
```

If you need to pass environment variables:

```lua
{
  acp_providers = {
    ["opencode"] = {
      command = "opencode",
      args = { "acp" },
      env = {
        OPENCODE_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENCODE_API_KEY")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Capabilities

OpenCode works the same via ACP as it does in the terminal. All features are supported:

- Built-in tools (file operations, terminal commands, etc.)
- Custom tools and slash commands
- MCP servers configured in your OpenCode config
- Project-specific rules from `AGENTS.md`
- Custom formatters and linters
- Agents and permissions system

:::note
Some built-in slash commands like `/undo` and `/redo` are currently unsupported in ACP mode.
