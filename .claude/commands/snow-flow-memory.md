# üß† Snow-Flow Memory System (Batchtools Optimized)

The memory system provides persistent storage for cross-session and cross-agent collaboration with CRDT-based conflict resolution.

**üöÄ Batchtools Enhancement**: Enhanced with parallel processing capabilities, batch operations, and concurrent optimization for improved performance.

## Store Information (Enhanced)

### Standard Storage
```bash
# Store with default namespace
./snow-flow memory store "key" "value"

# Store with specific namespace
./snow-flow memory store "architecture_decisions" "microservices with API gateway" --namespace arch
```

### Batch Storage (Optimized)
```bash
# Store multiple entries in parallel
./snow-flow memory batch-store entries.json --parallel

# Store with concurrent validation
./snow-flow memory concurrent-store "multiple_keys" "values" --namespace arch --validate

# Bulk storage with optimization
./snow-flow memory bulk-store project-data/ --recursive --optimize --parallel
```

## Query Memory (Enhanced)

### Standard Queries
```bash
# Search across all namespaces
./snow-flow memory query "authentication"

# Search with filters
./snow-flow memory query "API design" --namespace arch --limit 10
```

### Parallel Queries (Optimized)
```bash
# Execute multiple queries concurrently
./snow-flow memory parallel-query "auth,api,database" --concurrent

# Search across multiple namespaces simultaneously
./snow-flow memory concurrent-search "authentication" --namespaces arch,impl,test --parallel

# Batch query processing
./snow-flow memory batch-query queries.json --optimize --results-parallel
```

## Memory Statistics (Enhanced)

### Standard Statistics
```bash
# Show overall statistics
./snow-flow memory stats

# Show namespace-specific stats
./snow-flow memory stats --namespace project
```

### Performance Statistics (Optimized)
```bash
# Real-time performance monitoring
./snow-flow memory stats --real-time --performance

# Concurrent analysis across all namespaces
./snow-flow memory concurrent-stats --all-namespaces --detailed

# Batch performance analysis
./snow-flow memory performance-stats --optimization --benchmarks
```

## Export/Import (Enhanced)

### Standard Operations
```bash
# Export all memory
./snow-flow memory export full-backup.json

# Export specific namespace
./snow-flow memory export project-backup.json --namespace project

# Import memory
./snow-flow memory import backup.json
```

### Batch Operations (Optimized)
```bash
# Export multiple namespaces in parallel
./snow-flow memory concurrent-export namespaces.json --parallel --compress

# Batch import with validation
./snow-flow memory batch-import backups/ --validate --parallel

# Incremental export with optimization
./snow-flow memory incremental-export --since yesterday --optimize --concurrent
```

## Cleanup Operations (Enhanced)

### Standard Cleanup
```bash
# Clean entries older than 30 days
./snow-flow memory cleanup --days 30

# Clean specific namespace
./snow-flow memory cleanup --namespace temp --days 7
```

### Batch Cleanup (Optimized)
```bash
# Parallel cleanup across multiple namespaces
./snow-flow memory concurrent-cleanup --namespaces temp,cache --days 7 --parallel

# Smart cleanup with optimization
./snow-flow memory smart-cleanup --auto-optimize --performance-based

# Batch maintenance operations
./snow-flow memory batch-maintenance --compress --reindex --parallel
```

- Include timestamp for time-sensitive data with concurrent access
- Prefix with component name for batch processing clarity
- Use consistent naming patterns for automated batch operations

### Organization (Enhanced)
- Use namespaces to categorize data for parallel processing
- Store related data together for batch operations
- Keep values concise but complete for efficient concurrent access
- Implement hierarchical organization for smart batching

### Maintenance (Optimized)
- Regular backups with parallel export operations
- Clean old data with concurrent cleanup processes
- Monitor storage statistics with real-time performance tracking
- Compress large values with batch optimization
- Use incremental backups for efficiency

### Performance Optimization
- Use batch operations for multiple related memory operations
- Enable parallel processing for independent queries and storage
- Monitor concurrent operation limits to avoid resource exhaustion
- Implement smart caching for frequently accessed data

## Examples (Batchtools Enhanced)

### Store SPARC context with parallel operations:
```bash
# Batch store multiple SPARC contexts
./snow-flow memory batch-store sparc-contexts.json --namespace sparc --parallel

# Concurrent storage across multiple namespaces
./snow-flow memory concurrent-store spec,arch,impl "project data" --parallel --validate

# Performance-optimized bulk storage
./snow-flow memory bulk-store project-data/ --optimize --concurrent --compress
```

### Query project decisions with concurrent processing:
```bash
# Parallel queries across multiple namespaces
./snow-flow memory parallel-query "authentication" --namespaces arch,impl,test --concurrent

# Batch query processing with optimization
./snow-flow memory batch-query project-queries.json --optimize --results-concurrent

# Real-time search with performance monitoring
./snow-flow memory concurrent-search "API design" --real-time --performance
```

### Backup project memory with parallel processing:
```bash
# Concurrent export with compression
./snow-flow memory concurrent-export project-$(date +%Y%m%d).json --namespace project --compress --parallel

# Batch backup with incremental processing
./snow-flow memory batch-backup --incremental --all-namespaces --optimize

# Performance-optimized full backup
