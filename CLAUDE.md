# Claude Code Configuration - Snow-Flow Development Environment

## üö® CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### üî¥ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:

1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ‚ö° GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**‚úÖ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message**
```javascript
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Multiple Read/Write operations
  - Multiple Bash commands
```

**‚ùå WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)**
```javascript
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Read("file1.js")
// This is 3x slower and breaks coordination!
```

./snow-flow swarm "Create incident management dashboard with real-time updates"
# This automatically:
# ‚úÖ Discovers existing artifacts to reuse
# ‚úÖ Tests in real-time on your ServiceNow instance
# ‚úÖ Deploys automatically when ready
# ‚úÖ Shares context between all agents
```

### Research Workflow
```bash
./snow-flow swarm "Research modern web frameworks" --strategy research --mode distributed --parallel
./snow-flow sparc run researcher "Analyze React vs Vue performance"
./snow-flow memory store "research_findings" "Key insights"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
./snow-flow start --ui --port 3000
./snow-flow sparc tdd "User authentication system with JWT tokens"
./snow-flow swarm "Build e-commerce API" --strategy development --max-agents 8
```

## Integration Patterns

### Memory-Driven Coordination
```bash
# Store architecture decisions
./snow-flow memory store "system_architecture" "Microservices with API Gateway"

# All subsequent operations reference this decision
./snow-flow sparc run coder "Implement user service based on system_architecture"
```

### Multi-Stage Development
```bash
# Stage 1: Research and planning
./snow-flow sparc run researcher "Research authentication best practices"
./snow-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication system"

# Stage 2: Implementation
./snow-flow sparc tdd "User registration and login functionality"

# Stage 3: Testing and deployment
./snow-flow sparc run tester "Comprehensive security testing"
```

## Advanced Batch Tool Patterns

### TodoWrite Coordination
Always use TodoWrite for complex task coordination:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "architecture_design",
    content: "Design system architecture and component interfaces",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high",
    dependencies: [],
    estimatedTime: "60min",
    assignedAgent: "architect"
  },
  {
    id: "frontend_development", 
    content: "Develop React components and user interface",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium",
    dependencies: ["architecture_design"],
    estimatedTime: "120min",
    assignedAgent: "frontend_team"
  }
]);
```

## Code Style Preferences
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Destructure imports when possible
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains
- Prefer const/let over var

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always run typecheck after making code changes
- Run tests before committing changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before merging

## üìä MANDATORY AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Every Agent MUST Follow This Protocol

When you spawn an agent using the Task tool, that agent MUST:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ BEFORE Starting Work:**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks pre-task --description "[agent task]" --auto-spawn-agents false
npx snow-flow hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]" --load-memory true
```

**2Ô∏è‚É£ DURING Work (After EVERY Major Step):**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks post-edit --file "[filepath]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx snow-flow hooks notify --message "[what was done]" --telemetry true
```

**3Ô∏è‚É£ AFTER Completing Work:**
```bash
npx snow-flow hooks post-task --task-id "[task]" --analyze-performance true
npx snow-flow hooks session-end --export-metrics true --generate-summary true
```

### üéØ AGENT PROMPT TEMPLATE

When spawning agents, ALWAYS include these coordination instructions:

```
You are the [Agent Type] agent in a coordinated swarm.

MANDATORY COORDINATION:
1. START: Run `npx snow-flow hooks pre-task --description "[your task]"`
2. DURING: After EVERY file operation, run `npx snow-flow hooks post-edit --file "[file]"`
3. MEMORY: Store ALL decisions using `npx snow-flow hooks notify --message "[decision]"`
4. END: Run `npx snow-flow hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"`

Your specific task: [detailed task description]

REMEMBER: Coordinate with other agents by checking memory BEFORE making decisions!
```

## ‚ö° PARALLEL EXECUTION IS MANDATORY

**‚úÖ CORRECT (Parallel - ALWAYS DO THIS):**
```
Message 1: [BatchTool]
  // MCP coordination setup
  - mcp__snow-flow__swarm_init
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (researcher)
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (coder)
  - mcp__snow-flow__agent_spawn (analyst)

  // Task agents with full coordination instructions
  - Task("You are researcher agent. MANDATORY: Run hooks. Task: Research API patterns")
  - Task("You are coder agent. MANDATORY: Run hooks. Task: Implement REST endpoints")
  
  // TodoWrite with ALL todos batched
  - TodoWrite { todos: [
      {id: "research", content: "Research API patterns", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
      {id: "design", content: "Design database schema", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
      {id: "implement", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
      {id: "test", content: "Write unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"}
    ]}

  // File operations in parallel
  - Write "api/package.json"
  - Write "api/server.js"
  - Bash "mkdir -p api/{routes,models,tests}"
```

## üîÑ MEMORY COORDINATION PATTERN

Every agent coordination step MUST use memory:

```javascript
// After each major decision or implementation
mcp__snow-flow__memory_usage({
  action: "store",
  key: "swarm-{id}/agent-{name}/{step}",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    decision: "what was decided",
    implementation: "what was built",
    nextSteps: ["step1", "step2"],
    dependencies: ["dep1", "dep2"]
  })
})
```

### When to Use Which ML Approach?

```
DECISION TREE:
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
Is it a standard ServiceNow object? (incident/change/problem/request)
  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Do you have PI/PA license?
      ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use Native ML (best: 95%+ accuracy)

```

### Unique TensorFlow.js Scenarios:
- **Client-side Widget ML**: Real-time predictions in Service Portal
- **Custom Tables**: ML for u_employee_performance, u_vendor_rating, etc.
- **Form Intelligence**: Live validation and anomaly detection
- **Offline Mobile**: Predictions without connection
- **Privacy-First**: Sensitive calculations stay in browser
- **Custom Patterns**: Beyond standard ServiceNow capabilities

### Example Commands:
```bash
# Client-side ML widget
snow-flow swarm "Create widget with real-time typing predictions using client-side ML"

# Custom table ML
snow-flow swarm "Build ML predictions for u_vendor_performance custom table"

# Privacy-sensitive ML
snow-flow swarm "Create HR salary predictor that keeps data in browser"
```

## ü§ñ Dynamic Task Categorization (NEW in v2.5.0!)

Snow-Flow now uses AI-powered dynamic categorization instead of static patterns:

### Why Dynamic Categorization?
- **Multi-language support**: Auto-detects Dutch, English, French, Spanish, German
- **Context-aware**: Understands intent beyond keywords
- **Learning capability**: Improves over time
- **Edge case handling**: Better with ambiguous requests
- **Confidence scoring**: Know how certain the AI is

### Example Usage:
```javascript
// Old static pattern approach (limited)
const result = AgentDetector.analyzeTask("maak 5000 incidenten");

// NEW dynamic AI approach (intelligent)
const result = await mcp__snow-flow__task_categorize({
  objective: "maak een data set aan van 5000 random incidenten",
  context: {
    language: 'auto',    // Auto-detects Dutch
    maxAgents: 8,
    environment: 'development'
  }
});
```

### Returns Comprehensive Analysis:
```json
{
  "task_type": "data_generation",
  "primary_agent": "script-writer",
  "supporting_agents": ["tester"],
  "complexity": "simple",
  "confidence_score": 0.98,
  "intent_analysis": {
    "primary": "create",
    "action_verbs": ["create", "generate"],
    "target_objects": ["data", "incidents"],
    "quantifiers": [5000]
  },
  "approach": {
    "recommended_strategy": "sequential",
    "optimization_hints": ["Use batch operations", "Background Scripts"]
  }
}
```

## üß† Intelligent Agent Batching (NEW in v2.6.0!)

Snow-Flow now includes **Intelligent Dependency-Based Agent Batching** that automatically determines which agents can run in parallel vs sequential based on task dependencies!

### How It Works:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Each agent type has defined dependencies
   - `architect`/`app-architect` agents run first (no dependencies)
   - `script-writer` depends on architecture being complete
   - `css-specialist` depends on `widget-creator`
   - `tester` depends on all implementation agents

2. **Automatic Batching**: Agents are grouped into execution batches
   - **Sequential**: When dependencies require order
   - **Parallel**: When agents have no interdependencies

3. **Example Execution Plans**:

**Widget Development Task:**
```
Batch 1 - üì¶ SEQUENTIAL: [app-architect]
Batch 2 - ‚ö° PARALLEL: [widget-creator | integration-specialist]
Batch 3 - ‚ö° PARALLEL: [css-specialist | frontend-specialist | backend-specialist]
Batch 4 - ‚ö° PARALLEL: [performance-specialist | tester]

Time Reduction: 60% (4 batches instead of 7 sequential steps)
```

**Flow Development Task:**
```
Batch 1 - üì¶ SEQUENTIAL: [app-architect]
Batch 2 - üì¶ SEQUENTIAL: [flow-builder]
Batch 3 - ‚ö° PARALLEL: [trigger-specialist | action-specialist | approval-specialist | integration-specialist]
Batch 4 - ‚ö° PARALLEL: [error-handler | tester]

Time Reduction: 50% (4 batches instead of 8 sequential steps)
```

### Real Example from Swarm:

When you run: `snow-flow swarm "Create incident management dashboard widget"`

The system automatically generates:
```javascript
// Batch 1 - Architecture First
Task("app-architect", `You are the application architect. Design the overall application structure and component interfaces.
MANDATORY: 
1. Run npx snow-flow hooks pre-task --description "widget_development - app-architect"
2. Store ALL decisions in Memory with key "agent_app-architect_decisions"
3. Check Memory for work from agents you depend on
4. After EVERY file operation, run npx snow-flow hooks post-edit
5. When complete, run npx snow-flow hooks post-task --task-id "app-architect"`);

// ‚è∏Ô∏è WAIT for Batch 1 completion before proceeding to Batch 2

// Batch 2 - Main Components (PARALLEL)
Task("widget-creator", `You are the widget creator. Build the HTML structure for Service Portal widgets. Store widget specs in Memory.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);
Task("integration-specialist", `You are the integration specialist. Handle external system integrations and APIs.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);

// ‚è∏Ô∏è WAIT for Batch 2 completion before proceeding to Batch 3

// Batch 3 - Specialists (PARALLEL)
Task("css-specialist", `You are the CSS specialist. Create responsive styles for the widgets. Read widget structure from Memory.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);
Task("frontend-specialist", `You are the frontend specialist. Implement client-side JavaScript. Coordinate with backend via Memory.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);
Task("backend-specialist", `You are the backend specialist. Implement server-side logic. Coordinate with frontend via Memory.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);

// ‚è∏Ô∏è WAIT for Batch 3 completion before proceeding to Batch 4

// Batch 4 - Quality & Testing (PARALLEL)
Task("performance-specialist", `You are the performance specialist. Optimize code and queries for performance.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);
Task("tester", `You are the tester. Test all components created by other agents. Read their outputs from Memory.
MANDATORY: [same coordination instructions]`);
```

### Dependency Rules:

```javascript
const agentDependencies = {
  // Architecture/Design agents must run first
  'architect': [],
  'app-architect': [],
  
  // Script/Code agents depend on architecture
  'script-writer': ['architect', 'app-architect'],
  'coder': ['architect', 'app-architect'],
  
  // UI agents can run after architecture, parallel with backend
  'widget-creator': ['architect', 'app-architect'],
  'css-specialist': ['widget-creator'],
  'frontend-specialist': ['widget-creator'],
  'backend-specialist': ['architect', 'app-architect'],
  
  // Flow agents depend on architecture
  'flow-builder': ['architect', 'app-architect'],
  'trigger-specialist': ['flow-builder'],
  'action-specialist': ['flow-builder'],
  'approval-specialist': ['flow-builder'],
  
  // Integration agents can run in parallel with others
  'integration-specialist': ['architect'],
  'api-specialist': ['architect'],
  
  // Testing/Security agents run last
  'tester': ['script-writer', 'widget-creator', 'flow-builder', 'frontend-specialist', 'backend-specialist'],
  'security-specialist': ['script-writer', 'api-specialist'],
  'performance-specialist': ['frontend-specialist', 'backend-specialist'],
  
  // Error handling depends on main implementation
  'error-handler': ['flow-builder', 'script-writer'],
  
  // Documentation can run in parallel
  'documentation-specialist': [],
  
  // Specialized agents
  'ml-developer': ['architect', 'script-writer'],
  'database-expert': ['architect'],
  'analyst': ['architect']
};
```

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **40-60% faster execution** through intelligent parallelization
- ‚úÖ **Automatic dependency resolution** - no manual coordination needed
- ‚úÖ **Visual execution flow** - see exactly what runs when
- ‚úÖ **Memory coordination** - agents share context automatically
- ‚úÖ **No deadlocks** - circular dependencies handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Optimized resource usage** - maximum parallel efficiency

### Key Insights:
1. Architecture agents always run first (no dependencies)
2. UI specialists can run in parallel after widget creation
3. Flow specialists can run in parallel after flow builder
4. Testing always runs last (depends on implementation)
5. Integration agents have minimal dependencies
6. Security and performance agents run near the end
