Build Agent locks you into NowLLM only. Snow-Flow also works in any IDE, not just the browser-based Studio. Including any MID server you already have.",

      "a3": "Absolutely! Snow-Flow is 100% open source and free to use. Install it with npm, connect to your ServiceNow instance, and start building. Enterprise adds the portal, integrations, and stakeholder seats when you're ready to scale."
