Snow-Flow Advanced Features Implementation Request

PROJECT GOAL:
Enhance Snow-Flow with 14 new MCP tools that leverage AI capabilities to provide deep ServiceNow insights, automated documentation, and process mining features that would take humans days but AI can do in seconds.

FEATURE 1: Smart Batch API Operations
Create snow_batch_api tool that executes multiple ServiceNow operations in a single transaction. Should handle queries, updates, inserts, and deletes across different tables. Return organized results with execution time. Goal is 80 percent reduction in API calls.

FEATURE 2: Table Relationship Mapping  
Create snow_get_table_relationships tool that maps all dependencies for a given table. Show what tables it extends, references to other tables, and what references it. Include common query patterns. Maximum depth parameter to control traversal.

FEATURE 3: Query Performance Analyzer
Create snow_analyze_query tool that predicts query performance before execution. Identify missing indexes, suggest optimizations, and provide risk scores. Should work with complex encoded queries and return actionable improvements.

FEATURE 4: Field Usage Intelligence
Create snow_analyze_field_usage tool that discovers which fields are actually used in queries, views, reports, and business rules. Identify safe-to-deprecate fields and critical dependencies. Help clean technical debt safely.

FEATURE 5: Migration Helper
Create snow_create_migration_plan tool for moving data between tables. Auto-map fields with confidence scores, identify value mismatches, and generate migration scripts. Focus on custom to out-of-box table migrations.

FEATURE 6: Deep Table Analysis with AI
Create snow_analyze_table_deep tool that analyzes thousands of records to find patterns humans miss. Discover correlations like Monday incidents take longer to resolve or that certain assignment groups never resolve tickets. Find anomalies and optimization opportunities.

FEATURE 7: Code Pattern Detector
Create snow_detect_code_patterns tool that finds all variations of code patterns across business rules, client scripts, and script includes. For example, find all 234 different ways developers look up users, identify performance issues, and suggest unified approaches.

FEATURE 8: Predictive Impact Analysis
Create snow_predict_change_impact tool that predicts cascading effects before making changes. If adding a mandatory field to task table, predict how many forms break, which integrations fail, and what performance impact occurs. Include hidden impacts like mobile app crashes.

FEATURE 9: Auto Documentation Generator
Create snow_generate_documentation tool that reads tables, relationships, code, and usage patterns to generate complete technical documentation. Include mermaid diagrams, common query examples, performance tips, and pitfalls. AI writes better docs than most developers.

FEATURE 10: Intelligent Refactoring
Create snow_refactor_code tool that modernizes legacy ServiceNow code. Identify deprecated APIs, add error handling, convert synchronous to async operations, and follow best practices. Include migration guide showing what else needs updating.

FEATURE 11: Process Mining Engine
Create snow_discover_process tool that analyzes audit logs and state transitions to discover how processes really work versus documentation. Find patterns like ping-pong between teams, zombie tickets, and skip assignment flows. Identify bottlenecks and automation opportunities.

FEATURE 12: Workflow Reality Analyzer
Create snow_analyze_workflow_execution tool specifically for Flow Designer and Workflow Editor flows. Analyze thousands of executions to find where flows deviate from design, common failure points, and optimization opportunities.

FEATURE 13: Cross Table Process Discovery
Create snow_discover_cross_table_process tool that follows processes across multiple tables. For example, track a request from sc_request through req_item, task, asset, to incident. Find hidden patterns and compliance issues.

FEATURE 14: Real Time Process Monitoring
Create snow_monitor_process tool that watches processes in real-time and alerts on deviations, bottlenecks, or SLA risks. Detect when tickets bounce too many times or follow anti-patterns.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- All tools should integrate with existing Snow-Flow MCP architecture
- Cache results in Snow-Flow memory system for performance
- Tools should work with ServiceNow instances via REST API
- Respect all ACLs and security constraints
- Implement rate limiting to avoid instance impact
- Each tool should complete analysis in under 30 seconds
- Results should be actionable, not just informational

SUCCESS METRICS:
- Batch API reduces calls by 80 percent
- Query analyzer catches 90 percent of slow queries
- Process mining finds at least 5 optimization opportunities per process
- Documentation generator creates docs 10x faster than manual
- Pattern detector finds 95 percent of code variations

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- Use existing ServiceNow MCP server infrastructure
- Leverage Snow-Flow memory for caching and coordination
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Snow-Flow coding standards
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include unit tests for each tool

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. First implement features 1-5 (practical daily tools)
2. Then implement features 6-10 (AI-powered analysis)  
3. Finally implement features 11-14 (process mining)

This gives developers immediate value while building toward advanced process mining capabilities that will revolutionize how people understand their ServiceNow instances.
